    This service is going to deploy a simple default Bitnami PostreSQL db instance.
    You can find more info at https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql/.
    This database is running inside the cluster so it's probably not a good choice for production
    environments, at least with this default configuration.
